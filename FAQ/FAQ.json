    "question": "During the training courses, could we incorporate a segment to explore coordinate conversions for meteorological and oceanic sciences data, specifically in Python-based libraries and other tools, for coordinates such as isobaric, isentropic, sigma, and others?",
    "answer": "Certainly! We have extensive experience in restoring and manipulating the vertical topology of model-generated data. As a practical example, we have developed code that can reassign the geometric altitude of model mass points while preserving their terrain-following characteristics. This enables users to visualize complex model-generated data overlaid on existing topography. We implemented this using PARAVIEW and WRF model data, and the results were impressive. This topic has the potential to cover both coding and visualization, offering numerous opportunities for exploration and utilization. In that particular case, we collaborated with KITWARE, the company behind PARAVIEW software, to develop this new functionality. With this enhancement, it would be easier to incorporate terrain-following model data into PARAVIEW. We presented two possible approaches for achieving this. The first approach involves classical interpolation techniques, while the second approach requires converting the model data into PARAVIEW's native data format, called \"vtk\". This technique works seamlessly with both atmospheric and ocean data, which are both terrain-following. The outcome is a flawless alignment between the model's output and the underlying terrain or seabed. Also, if you want to know more or have any other questions, feel free to reach out to us.
